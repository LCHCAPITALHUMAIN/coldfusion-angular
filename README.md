coldfusion-angular
==================

A sample application using angularjs written with ColdFusion (cfclient)

This is just a reference implementation to showcase one of the ways cfclient can be used to develop an angular application.

Server cfc needs conf db. Alternatively it can be changed to just use some application variables
